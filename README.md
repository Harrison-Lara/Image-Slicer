# Image-Slicer
You are required to implement a solution
that reads the text based PPM files. Since they are text files you can open with them with the
python open function just like any text file. The directories will also have jpg files. Using the jpg
files will be extra credit. The program you write will ask the user for a directory, if the files in that
directory are valid image files then you will sort them by their names and create a new image
with slices of the other images. The number of images in each directory will not be constant. If
there are 10 source images, then your output image will take 1/10 of a horizontal slice from the
input images.
